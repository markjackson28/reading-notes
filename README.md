## About Me :bowtie:
Hi! My name is Mark and I would like to tell you a bit about myself. I am a veteran originally from Chicago. The military is what brought me out to the beautiful state of Washington. After my time in the military, I decided to pursue a degree in music production and audio engineering at Shoreline Community College. Shortly after graduating, I became a personal trainer for a bit. I then closed that chapter in my life and decided to try out software development. I am now a student at Code Fellows and cannot wait for what is ahead for me! :rocket:
