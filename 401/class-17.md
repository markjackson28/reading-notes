## Summary/Notes of readings

*Describe “The Cloud”.*
- ‘on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.’ [Ref.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing)

*What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?*
- ‘A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.’ [Ref.](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)

*What is auto-scaling?*
- ‘A method used in cloud computing that dynamically adjusts the amount of computational resources in a server farm - typically measured by the number of active servers - automatically based on the load on the farm.’ [Ref.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoscaling)

*What is bandwidth?*
- ‘The maximum rate of data transfer across a given path.’ [Ref.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing))

*How do cloud providers compute service costs?*
- Storage, networking and computing.

*Terms*
- Server Instances: ‘a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance.’ [Ref.](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32149/server-instance)
- Containers: A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.’ [Ref.](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)
- Cloud Services: ‘on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.’ [Ref.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing)
- Cloud Architecture: ‘the various components in terms of databases, software capabilities, applications, etc. engineered to leverage the power of cloud resources to solve business problems.’ [Ref.](https://www.hcltech.com/technology-qa/what-is-cloud-architecture)
- AWS: Amazon Web Services.
- EC2/Beanstalk vs. Heroku: Pricing.
