### Summary/Notes of Readings

Article One: [The code I’m still ashamed of](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e)

I found this article to be pretty interesting and not what I expected the article to be. Long story short, a person wrote code for a pharmaceutical company. The code was a test to target young, female teenagers; the drug ended up ending a teenagers life due to the side effects of the drug. The dev ended up resigning right after. This is very unfortunate that this happened and I understand why the dev is ashamed about what they wrote. If I were to be completely honest, the dev had a job to do and they did it. I wouldn’t say the dev was fully responsible. Either way, someone else would have wrote it. If a dev comes across writing something like that and does not align with their ethics, then don’t write it. For myself, I most likely would’t work for a pharmaceutical company since it does not align with my ethics.

Article Two: [Ethical dilemma of self driving cars](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/technology/the-ethical-dilemmas-of-self-drivingcars/article37803470/)

I also found this article interesting and the topic is about self driving vehicles and how the vehicle decides to take action in an accident. If a child suddenly jumps in front of a car, what path should the vehicle take? This apparently is a big debate and was not really addressed in the vehicle industry. From my point of view, I would really hope that there are extensive testing before launching a self driving vehicle. You would image that someone in the industry had to think of that and set a team to test that. If the technology is there, I would rather trust an AI. The only reason I say that is most people don’t have the reaction time of a machine. I believe a machine can make a better split decision, given the correct parameters.
