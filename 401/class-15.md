## Summary/Notes of readings

*[Trees](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-15/resources/Trees.html)*

- ‘Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.’
- ‘A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it.’
- ‘Searching a BST can be done quickly, because all you do is compare the node you are searching for against the root of the tree or sub-tree.’

*Terms*

- Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain it’s own values, and references to other nodes
- Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
- K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, `k = 2`.
- Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
- Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
- Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
- Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf
