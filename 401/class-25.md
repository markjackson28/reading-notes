## Summary/Notes of readings

*Describe use cases useState() vs useReducer()*
- useReducer() when you have a more complex state and useState() when managing simple/independent state.

*Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?*
- To give it more context on what the hook may used for.

*What do custom hooks usually do?*
- Allows you to create a custom hook in combination of supplied hooks from state/React.

*Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications.*
- Maybe created a custom api fetch hook using useEffect() and useState.

*Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work*
- Utilize useEffect() inside the custom hook to fetch the data.

*Terms*

- Reducer: ‘The `reduce()` method executes a user-supplied “reducer” callback function on each element of the array, in order, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element. The final result of running the reducer across all elements of the array is a single value.’ [Ref.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce)

*Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?*
- Not much.

*Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?*
- React, State, functional components.

*What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?*
- `useReducer`.
