- Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to `pop` an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- Top - This is the top of the stack.
- Peek - When you `peek` you will view the value of the `top` Node in the stack. When you attempt to `peek` an empty stack an exception will be raised.
