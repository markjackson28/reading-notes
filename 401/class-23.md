## Summary/Notes of readings

*How can we ensure that an effect hook runs only once?*

- `useEffect()` takes in a second argument in which you van check against in there or you can put and empty array as the param.

*Can `useState()` update more than one state variable at the same time?*

- Yes. You can open up `useState()` as an object and put in the key and value pairs.

*Is `useState()` synchronous?*

- No, `useState()` is asynchronous.

*Terms*

- State Hook: 'A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example, `useState` is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. We’ll learn other Hooks later.' [Ref.](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)

- Component Lifecycle: 'the series of methods that are invoked in different stages of the component’s existence.' [Ref](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs-lifecycle-components/)

*Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?*

- useState.

*Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?*

- React, State, functional components.

*What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?*

- `useState()` and `useEffect()`.
