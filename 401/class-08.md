## Summary/Notes of readings

*When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?*
- Basic is used to get username/password initially. Bearer is used throughout the site rather than passing the username/password around.

*What does the JSON Web Token package do?*
- ‘JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.’[Ref.](https://jwt.io/introduction)

*What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?*
- To add it to the .env file.

*Terms*
- Encryption: ‘securing digital data using one or more mathematical techniques, along with a password or "key" used to decrypt the information.’[Ref.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/encryption.asp)

- Token: is a digital security token for two-factor authentication systems.[Ref.](https://www.easytechjunkie.com/what-is-a-software-token.htm)
Bearer: ‘The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.”’[Ref.](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/)

- Secret: ‘secret key is private to you which means you will never reveal that to the public or inject inside the JWT token.’[Ref.](https://medium.com/jspoint/so-what-the-heck-is-jwt-or-json-web-token-dca8bcb719a6#:~:text=JWT%20is%20created%20with%20a,key%20stored%20on%20the%20server.)

- JSON Web Token: ‘JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.’[Ref.](https://jwt.io/introduction)

*Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?*
- A little bit more about JWT but not much from last time.

*Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?*
- JWT, sequelize, and SECRET.

*What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?*
- JWT and implementing roles.
