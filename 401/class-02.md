## Summary/Notes of readings 

*What’s the difference between ```PUT``` and ```PATCH```?*
- ```PUT``` has to update the entire data where ```PATCH``` updates the just the selected data.

*Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like ```json-server```.*
- Insomnia, Nock, and MockServer.

*Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js. Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?*
- apiDocjs: ‘Inline Documentation for RESTful web APIs. It creates a documentation from API annotations in your source code. It includes a default template which uses handlebars, Bootstrap, RequireJS and jQuery for the output of the generated apidata.js and apiproject.js as a html-page.’
- Swagger: ‘Test and Document Your APIs With Ease. It is a free cloud-based API testing and documentation tool to simplify the validation of any API and generate its corresponding OpenAPI documentation.’

*Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST.*
- REST: ‘all about simplicity, facilitate client-server communications and architectures, use a single uniform interface, optimized for the web, and known for excellent performance and scalability.’
- SOAP: ‘much tighter security, successful/retry logic for reliable messaging functionality, and has built-in ACID compliance.’

*Terms*
- Web Server: Hardware side, a computer that holds a websites component files. Software side, how the files are accessed/called.
- Express: ‘Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.’
- Routing: ‘the process of selecting a path for traffic in a network or between or across multiple networks.’
- WRRC: Web Request Response Cycle.

*Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?*
- Functions
- State
- Props

*Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?*
- Loops
- Modularizing code. I get really lost on how certain files communicate with each other and I want to understand that a more.
- Reinforcement on functions/methods (I understand that basics but still want a bit more clarity on functions and various methods)

*What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?*
- More things about the server side such as the API calls.
