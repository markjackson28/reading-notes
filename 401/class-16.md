## Summary/Notes of readings

*Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle*
- On the web, there is a ‘request’ of information from the client and a ‘response’ that is sent back to the client from the server.

*Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC.*
- ‘On the software side, a web server includes several parts that control how web users access hosted files.’ [Ref.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server)

*What does it mean to “deploy” an application?*
- ‘The general deployment process consists of several interrelated activities with possible transitions between them. These activities can occur at the producer side or at the consumer side or both.’ [Ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_deployment)
