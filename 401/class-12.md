## Summary/Notes of readings

*What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?* 
- To make is more safe and scaleable. 

*UDP is often refereed too as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?* 
- Because UDP does not establish a connection; it just sends.

*Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?* 
- Yes.

*Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?* 
- Yes.

*Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?* 
- Yes.

*Terms*
- Observer Pattern: ‘a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.' [Ref.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)
- Listener:  ‘a procedure in JavaScript that waits for an event to occur.’ [Ref.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-addeventlistener-with-examples/)
- Event Handler: ‘a block of code (usually a JavaScript function that you as a programmer create) that runs when the event fires.’ [Ref.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events)
- Event Driven Programming: ‘a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or message passing from other programs or threads.’ [Ref.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming)
- Event Loop: ‘a programming construct or design pattern that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program.’ [Ref.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop)
- Event Queue: a queue for events
- Call Stack: ‘a stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program. This kind of stack is also known as an execution stack, program stack, control stack, run-time stack, or machine stack, and is often shortened to just "the stack”.’ [Ref.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack)
- Emit/Raise/Trigger: Emit: Emitting a signal out, Raise: not sure, - Trigger: setting off an event
- Subscribe: ‘an object that represents a disposable resource, usually the execution of an Observable.’ [Ref.](https://rxjs.dev/guide/subscription)
- database: collection of data

*Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?*
- Not much so far.

*Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?*
- Events, Socket.io, and more testing.

*What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?*
- Events with a front end.
