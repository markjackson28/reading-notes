## Summary/Notes of readings

*Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)*
- Angular, Vue.js, Ember.js, Meteor, and Mithril.

*What’s the difference between a framework and a library?*
- ‘When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.’ [Ref.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-difference-between-a-framework-and-a-library-bd133054023f/)

*Terms*
