## Summary/Notes of readings

*Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development.*
- Better code quality, make sure your functions are doing what they are supposed to be doing, and reduces project development.

*In what case would you need to use `beforeEach()` or `afterEach()` in a test suite?*
- If you have repeating setups for tests.

*What is one downside of Test Driven Development.*
- If you don’t write the test correctly, they can produce a false-positive.

*What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?*
- ES6 uses `class` vs a `function`.

*Why REST?*
- Because its more flexible.

*Terms*
- Functional programming:  ‘functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.’
- Object-oriented programming (OOP): ‘Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.’
- Class: ‘an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).’
- `super`: ‘a keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.’
- `this`: ‘refers to the object it belongs to.’
- Test Driven Development (TDD): a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.
- Jest: 'a testing framework'
- Continuous Integration (CI): ‘is the development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently.’
- REST: ‘A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style.’
Data Model: ‘an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.’

*Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?*
- Express, tests, and jest.

*Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?*
- Jest, more testing, and REST.

*What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?*
- REST.
