## Summary/Notes of readings

*Why is access control important?*
- So we can control/monitor who is able to view authorized information.

*Describe an application that would need access control.*
- Something like an email; the only person who should have access to that is you but I’m sure that the main site owner/admin would be be able to access that. Or military applications.

*What is a role used for?*
- A title that has capabilities added to it.

*Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?*
- Because role based is generic whereas discretionary and mandatory require a lot more security added to it.

*Terms*
- Authorization: having the rights to access certain information.
- Role Based Access Control: ‘an approach to restricting system access to authorized users.’[Ref.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)
- Capabilities: what you are able to do within CRUD.

*Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?*
- Not much so far.

*Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?*
- Tests, auth, and linked list.

*What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?*
- More about the backend capabilities.
