## Summary/Notes of readings

*What are serverless functions?*
- ‘A serverless function is a programmatic function written by a software developer for a single purpose. It's then hosted and maintained on infrastructure by cloud computing companies. These companies take care of code maintenance and execution so that developers can deploy new code faster and easier.’ [Ref.](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/serverless-functions)

*If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?*
- You can use something called ‘Node Lambda’ in which you can run in your code editor. [Ref.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-lambda)

*Describe how a CDN works*
- Having multiple servers that are linked together to create a faster/reliable network. [Ref.](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/)
