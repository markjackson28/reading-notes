## Summary/Notes of readings

*Terms*

- Graphs: A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of `vertices` (or `nodes`) potentially connected by line segments named `edges`.
- Vertex: A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
- Edge: An edge is a connection between two nodes.
- Neighbor: The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
- Degree: The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.
- Undirected Graph: a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.
- Directed Graph: also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.
- Completed Graph: A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
- Connected Graph: A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.
- Disconnected Graph: A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.
