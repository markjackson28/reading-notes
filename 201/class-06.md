## Summary/Notes of readings

*Understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming*

- Try to dissect the elements of the problem/code into smaller problems and understand how it works.
- If you’re having trouble, find a different way to use that tool that makes sense to you and understand how that tool is being used in that application.
- Break down the code to make it easier to comprehend.

*JS Chapter 3: Objects and Literals (pp.100-105)

- Objects combine variables and functions to create a “model”.
- Variables are know as properties and functions are know as the method.
- Separate the values by a color but not after the last value.

*JS Chapter 5: Document Object Model (pp.183-242)*

- DOM is not HTML or Java; it is its own applications and has its own rules.
- DOM creates a ‘tree’ on how to access or change certain parts of HTML.
- Parts of the DOM tree: document, element, attributes, and text nodes.
- getElementByID(‘id’) and querySelector(‘css selector’) are common methods to return elements.
- You can grab elements by using previousSibling, nextSibling, firstChild, lastChild.
- You can also grab elements by their id or class.
- You can add or remove HTML content by either the innerHTML and DOM manipulation.
- You can view different browsers DOM properties.
