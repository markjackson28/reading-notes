*JS Chapter 10: Error Handling & Debugging (p.449-486)*

- Order of execution is crucial for code to run.
- Two phases of activity: Prepare then execute.
- An error object it created when a code does not run properly.
- Error object components: name (type of error), message (description), fileNumber (name of the Javascript file), lineNumber (line number of the error).
- Types of errors: Error, SyntaxError, ReferenceError, TypeError, RangeError, URIError, EvalError.
- Two ways to fix errors: debug the script to fix errors and handle errors gracefully.
- Debugging workflow: where is the problem? Then figure out the problem once you find it.
- Console is the place to look for errors if you encounter any. The console should usually always be open.
- Breakpoints allows you to pause the execution of the code. 
- You can have multiple breakpoints and step through the code to see where it might break.
- If you have a feeling that the code might break, used the try, catch, and finally method.
- Common errors: capitalization of letters, let variables, using reserve words, single and double quotes, spelling, and data type issues.
