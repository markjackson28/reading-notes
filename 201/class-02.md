## Summary/Notes of readings 

*HTML Chapter 2: Text (pp.40-61)*

- Tags are known as markup and allows the browser to show structure to the user.

- HTML has 6 levels of headings from <h1\> being to biggest to <h6\> being the smallest. 

- In order to create a paragraph, you will need to add an opening tag <p\> and a closing tag </p\> to the phrase.

- A new paragraph tag will automatically input the phrase on a new line.

- To make it a bit easier to read, you can add white space to the line and it will not affect the outcome. 

*HTML Chapter 10: Introducing CSS (pp.226-245)*

- CSS stands for *Cascading Style Sheets*.

- CSS has a "selector"(a character from the HTML file that determines what is going style) and has a "declaration"(what the style is going to be).

- CSS can be using external or internal with HTML.

- By using external, you will have to link the CSS file into the HTML using a 'href' path. This means you will have a separate CSS file to work on to keep the HTML cleaner and easier to read.

*JS Chapter 2: Basic JavaScript Instructions (pp.53-84)*

- Be aware that Java is case sensitive.

- Comments are encouraged so you and other users know what to expect as a potential outcome of the code.

- With JavaScript there is variable keyword which is var and a variable name which is chosen by the writer. Then the variable name is assigned a value or some sort of output. 

- If there are multiple variables of the same name, it is best to use camelCase. Which means to lowercase the first letter of the variable and capitalize the second instance of the word.

*JS Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops (pp.145-162)*

- Flow charts are helpful to plan for the execution of the script.

- Decisions and loops usually use a combination of if and else statements along with operators to determine what statement does.
