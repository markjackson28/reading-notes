## Summary/Notes of readings

*HTML Chapter 15: Tables (pp.358-404)*

- Block-level elements within a HTML is when a certain tag is used, it creates its ‘own’ block and when another tag is used, it stacks under the previous tag building off if it.
- Inline elements is have the text wrap or flow around an object.
- Containing elements is having multiple ‘boxes’ within the file and having the contents in those boxes. This can be useful for separately designing a block of section.
- Different types of positioning schemes: normal flow, relative, absolute, fixed, overlapping, and floating.
- When designing the layout, remember that the site may be used on multiple devices that means the resolution will vary on whomever is visiting the site.
- Fixed width layouts have a set width and will not automatically adjust to whatever screen you’re using.
- Liquid layouts adjust accordingly to the browser.

*HTML Chapter 15: Tables (pp.358-404) Extended for Class 8*

- Normal Flow: each block level element is on top of each other.
- Relative Positioning: relative moves the element left, right, top, or bottom from its normal positioning.
- Absolution Positioning: this takes the element of of flow and can be place wherever and does not affect the other elements. This will make the element make the element stay where it is when you scroll though the page.
- Fixed: this will make the element stay in a “fixed” position. Meaning it will stay in its position and on screen wherever you move the screen.
- Overlapping elements: you can add the z-element to help with the overlapping elements.
- Float: this will move the elements left or right from its normal flow.
- Designers try to stay within a 960-1000px width.
- You can have multiple CSS files on one page.
