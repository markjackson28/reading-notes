*Who is Roy Fielding?*

- Computer scientist who is ‘the originator of Representational State Transfer (REST) and principal authors of the HTTP specification’.

*Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?*

- Because of the design; it did not allow it and have certain requirements.

*What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?*

- ‘A general purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns’ for URL’s.

*What does a ```GET``` do?*

- How a system retrieves information from one machine to another.

*What does a ```POST``` do?*

- If a ‘system needs to add something to another system’.

*What does ```PUT``` do?*

- 'System needs to add something to another system’

*What does ```PATCH``` do?*
