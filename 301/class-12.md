[NoSQL vs SQL](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)

*Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:*

| SQL                                                                      | noSQL                                                       |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data uses Schemas                                                        | Schema-less                                                 |
| Relations                                                                | No (or very few) Relations                                  |
| Data is distributed across multiple tables                               | Data is typically merged/nested in a few collections        |
| Horizontal calling is difficult/impossible; Vertical scaling is possible | Both horizontal and vertical scaling is possible            |
| Limitations for lots of (thousands) read and write queries per second    | Great performance for mass (simple) read and write requests |

*What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?*

- ‘Data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data.’

*Give a real world example.*

- Any data in a table format with rows such as storing first and last names.

*What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?*

- ‘Document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.’

*Give a real world example.*

- User profiles.

*Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?*

- NoSQL.

*What does SQL stand for?*

- Structured Query Language.

*What is a relational database?*

- ‘A relational database is a collection of data items with pre-defined relationships between them.’ 

*What type of structure does a relational database work with?*

- Tables.

*What is a ‘schema’?*

- Fields(Columns).

*What is a NoSQL database?*

- A database that stores data other than tables.

*How does it work?*

- Database>Collections>Documents.

*What is inside of a Mongo database?*

- A lot of data that works in an efficient way.

*Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.*

- Depends on what your data looks like. Choose whatever fits your needs.

*What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?*

- Not the best for updating.
